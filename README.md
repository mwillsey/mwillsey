### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a post-doctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Washington.

Check out more at my [website](https://www.mwillsey.com).

My current focus is [`egg`],
a toolkit for program optimization and synthesis
powered by e-graphs and equality saturation.
We've applied it to some really fun domains like
  [improving floating point accuracy](https://herbie.uwplse.org),
  [shrinking 3D models](//mwillsey.com/papers/pldi-szalinski),
  and
  [linear algebra optimization](//mwillsey.com/papers/tensat).
